      # If these prebuilt solutions don't work for you, you can always write temporary files
      #   yourself. The File::Temp module helps by automatically creating a unique temporary
      #   file name and by cleaning up the file after you are done with it. This can be especially
      #   handy if you need to completely create a new version of a file, but replace it only
      #   once you're done creating it:
      use File::Temp qw(tempfile);
      my ($fh,$file_name) = tempfile();
      while (<>) {
        print {$fh} uc $_;
      }
      $fh->close;
      rename $file_name => $final_name;

      # File::Temp can even create a temporary directory that you can use to store multiple
      #   files in. You can fetch several Web pages and store them for later processing:
      use File::Temp qw(tempdir);
      use File::Spec::Functions; 
      use LWP::Simple qw(getstore);

      my ($temp_dir) = tempdir(CLEANUP=>1);
      my %searches = (
        google => 'http://www.google.com/#h1=en&q=perl',
        yahoo => 'http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=perl',
        microsoft => 'http://www.bing.com/search?q=perl',
      );
      foreach my $search (keys %searches) {
        getstore ($searches{$search},
          catfile($temp_dir,$search));
      }
      # There's one caution with File::Temp: it opens its files in binary mode. If you need
      #   line-ending translations or a different encoding (Item 63), you have the use 
      #   binmode on the filehandle yourself.
